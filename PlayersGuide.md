## Getting Started in the Gallery

Upon spawning in the lobby of the gallery, you'll find the entrance to a "testing area" on your left and the entrance to the gallery on your right.

The gallery is filled with numerous rooms where you can play games. While no cabinets come bundled with the game, you can easily download or create your own. Collecting cabinets is part of the experience, just like many people do in real life. The game will automatically deploy the cabinets for you.

If you own game ROMs, you can play them just like in RetroArch. Walk up to a game cabinet, insert a coin, and start playing.

You'll also encounter NPCs hanging out and playing games, just like in a real arcade. If someone else is playing the game you want, you'll have to wait your turn â€“ a familiar experience from your childhood!

The gallery has plenty of rooms to accommodate all your cabinets, and the game will deploy them for you. New rooms will be added with each release.

While some rooms are generic, others are themed or have special features, so keep an eye out for surprises!

## Quest Controls

In Age of Joy, the controls behave differently depending on whether you are in Simulation Mode or Emulation Mode.

- **Simulation Mode**: Use the primary joystick for forward and lateral movements, and the secondary joystick for rotation. You can walk and move freely within the simulation.
- **Emulation Mode**: When you insert a coin and a game ROM is present, you enter Emulation Mode. In this mode, you can't walk or rotate, as the Quest Controls are instead used to play the game.

To exit Emulation Mode, grip the left controller and wait a few seconds. Age of Joy will return to Simulation Mode (returning movement control to you), and the emulation will end.

The control scheme in Emulation Mode varies by game but is generally consistent. Move with the primary joystick, shoot with the B button, perform other actions with the A button, etc.

## How to Insert a Coin

[![AGE of Joy Inserting Coin](https://img.youtube.com/vi/MYOKp9lI_7o/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/MYOKp9lI_7o)

In both Simulation and Emulation Modes, look at your left wrist to find a coin. Pick it up with your right hand (holding the right grip button) and insert it into the cabinet's coin slot. If a compatible ROM is present, the game emulation will start.

Afterward, a new coin will appear on your wrist, providing you with an infinite supply of coins to enjoy your favorite games (unlike when you were a kid and your pockets emptied too fast!)

When the game emulation starts, it goes through an initialization process similar to when the machine is turned on. This can be inconvenient, as it's not what you'd expect when inserting a coin. To address this, Age of Joy saves the game state after initialization. However, this feature may not always work, as it depends on the specific game.
