AGE of Joy is a lovingly recreation of that heady mix of electronic beeps, flashing lights, and the neon-lit cacophonous wonderland of a late 20th-century arcade. Remember the anticipation as you dropped your coins into the slot, the thrill of chasing high scores? Now, you can relive those magical moments with your Meta Quest headset.

This VR simulation is a love letter to the golden era of gaming, when people gathered in arcades to experience the latest and greatest games. We invite you to enter this digital sanctuary, where gaming history is preserved and shared with everyone.
